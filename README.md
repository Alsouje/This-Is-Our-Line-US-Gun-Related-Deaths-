# US-Gun--Related-Deaths-Rates

Where US and third world countries rates meet

I came up with the idea for this project after seeing the growing of the hashtag __#ThisIsOurLane__ when an American doctor’s tweet response to NRA’s “stay in their lane” went viral.

US has a very high rate of gun-shot deaths. There are decades of conflict between the medical and science community, who have called the rise in gun violence a public health crisis.

Doctors interpreted National Rifle Association’ tweet (NRA, America’s most influential gun rights group) as foul language and it was the trigger for Doctor Judy Melinek’s post which quickly gained support from other doctors and forensic pathologists.

I have decided to use this topic as my first Python project, analyzing firearm-related death rates in US between 2012-2014. My aim was to find patterns in the data that shows reasons behind the medical’s community reaction to NRA’s tweet.
