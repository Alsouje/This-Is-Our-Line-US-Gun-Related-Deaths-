# US-Gun--Related-Deaths-Rates

Where US and Third World Rates Meet

I came up with the idea for this project after seeing the growth of the hashtag __#ThisIsOurLane__ when an American doctor’s tweet response to NRA’s “stay in their lane” went viral.

US has a very high rate of gun-shot deaths. There are decades of conflict between the medical and scientific community, who have called the rise in gun violence a public health crisis.

Doctors interpreted National Rifle Association’ tweet (NRA, America’s most influential gun rights group) as foul language and it was the trigger for Doctor Judy Melinek’s post which quickly gained support from other doctors and forensic pathologists.

I have decided to use this topic as my first Python project, analyzing firearm-related death rates in US between 2012-2014. My aim was to find patterns in the data that shows reasons behind the medical’s community reaction to NRA’s tweet.


This project was created after a two-month time studying Python language in my spare time while also preparing for my final exams and my graduate job. 

You will notice that the code used is not exactly rocket science coding. However, the completion of this project made me very proud of myself owing to the fact I have never been evolved with any programming language previously. 

While learning python Anaconda was the package management chosen. Half way in the process of learning Python, Anaconda Navigator stopped working which was very frustrating at the time, but with a feel google researches I discovered Stack Overflow community. Fixing the issue was very challenging, it took me an entire Saturday to figure it out what was wrong. 

Actually! To be honest, by this time I still don’t know what the issue was exactly, but I fixed it and I guess that’s what counts. I used Anaconda prompt and followed these commands:

>>>conda update conda
>>>conda update anaconda-navigator
>>>anaconda-navigator --reset
>>>anaconda-navigator

Like magic, after hours trying, Anaconda Navigator was back and despite all the frustration it comforted me when I realized that getting stuck (sometimes in very small things) is a huge part of the leaning process.

As my first project I have develop all coding and notes in Jupyter Notebook. It helped to keep the project with a clean-view, constructing a logic map with the flow of ideas when analyzing the data. 

I expect for the next projects to have a better data visualization as I start touch upon Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy.

Externals data and information used in this project can be found in the PROJECT CONSIDERATIONS file.
